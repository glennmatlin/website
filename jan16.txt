Got it—your center of gravity is **AI for socio‑technical systems (STS)**, not hiring and not any single project like wargaming. Below is a clean, reusable set of **core artifacts** you can keep updated. I’ve foregrounded the STS narrative and your RAPID‑AI theme throughout.

## 3) Thesis statement (3–4 sentences)

My PhD towards **RAPID‑AI**, develops methods that enable language‑model (LM) systems to support **interactive, high‑stakes decision‑making** in **socio‑technical systems (STS)**—domains where outcomes depend on both technical facts and human institutions (e.g., finance, government, security, law, medicine). I focus on three pillars: (**i**) **measurement**—constructing grounded, expert‑level evaluations of STS knowledge and reasoning; (**ii**) **training**—using curated/synthetic data, supervised fine‑tuning, and reinforcement learning to improve **reasoning, analysis, and planning**; and (**iii**) **assurance**—methods for **transparency, interpretability, and trust calibration** so humans understand and reliably use LM recommendations. The result is a general methodology and open artifacts—datasets, models, and evaluation protocols—that **transfer across domains** and raise the reliability of LM‑assisted decisions.

## 4) Abstract (≈175 words)

Decision‑making in **socio‑technical systems (STS)** demands accurate knowledge, long‑horizon reasoning, and sensitivity to human constraints. Current LMs excel on narrow tasks yet remain brittle on **open‑ended, high‑stakes** problems where evidence is diffuse, rewards are ambiguous, and human values matter. **RAPID‑AI** advances LM decision support through three integrated contributions.
**(1) Measurement:** I introduce a scalable pipeline to build **grounded, expert‑level evaluations** from authoritative STS sources, producing cited QA pairs and multi‑step tasks that test knowledge, multi‑hop reasoning, planning, and trade‑off analysis.
**(2) Training:** I develop **curation‑to‑SFT‑to‑RL** methods that leverage structured prompts, diverse synthetic reasoning traces, and fidelity checks (citation validation, semantic deduplication, OOD filtering) to improve **generalizable reasoning** rather than domain memorization.
**(3) Assurance:** I study **cognitive patterns** in LM chains, apply **mechanistic/behavioral interpretability** and **trust calibration** techniques, and deliver human‑facing artifacts (rationales, uncertainty signals, constraint checks) that make model behavior **legible and auditable**.
Across finance, government, and security case studies—plus additional STS domains for generalization—RAPID‑AI demonstrates **higher reliability on in‑distribution and OOD tasks**, clearer explanations, and better human‑AI alignment for consequential decisions.

## 5) Research vision & narrative (concise, ~800 words)

### Motivation

Real decisions in **finance, government, security, law, and medicine** are **socio‑technical**: facts live in complex institutions; consequences are high‑stakes; and success requires not just answers but **plans, trade‑offs, and accountability**. LMs are now embedded in these workflows, yet we lack **robust ways to measure, train, and assure** their behavior for **open‑ended decision‑making**.

### Core questions

1. **Measurement:** How can we **systematically measure** domain‑specific knowledge and decision quality in STS using **grounded, automatically generated** evaluations?
2. **Training:** Which **data curation, SFT, and RL** methods actually **improve reasoning, analysis, and planning**—and **transfer** across domains and novel tasks?
3. **Assurance:** Which **transparency and calibration** techniques help practitioners **trust** and **appropriately use** LM recommendations under uncertainty and institutional constraints?
<!-- 
### Approach (RAPID‑AI)

**A. Grounded STS evaluation pipeline.** Starting from **authoritative sources**, I normalize documents, preserve structure, and produce **chunk‑plus‑global** contexts. I then guide LM ensembles to generate **cited questions/tasks** spanning factual, multi‑hop, numeric, and planning types. Outputs carry **inline quotes/citations**, are **teacher‑graded**, **citation‑validated** (string‑match/fuzzy alignment), and **deduplicated** (embedding clusters). Difficulty is calibrated using response patterns from smaller models. This yields **weighted, diverse STS benchmarks** with clear provenance.

**B. Training for generalizable reasoning.** Rather than chase pretraining scale, I focus on **tractable levers** that move reasoning quality:

* **Curated & synthetic data** to cover **decision templates** (diagnose → hypothesize → plan → evaluate trade‑offs → recommend), not just single answers.
* **Supervised fine‑tuning (SFT)** on **multi‑step, self‑consistent chains** with exact‑duplicate filtering and OOD guards to prevent shortcut learning.
* **Reinforcement learning (RL)** with **structure‑aware rewards** (grounding, consistency, constraint satisfaction, and outcome checks) to improve planning quality, not verbosity.
* **Sampling strategies** (e.g., multi‑sample self‑agreement) to extract stable rationales and reduce hallucinated steps.

**C. Assurance and interpretability.** To make behavior **legible and auditable**, I combine:

* **Mechanistic/behavioral interpretability** to identify recurrent **cognitive patterns** (e.g., premature closure, goal drift, spurious citation).
* **Trust calibration**: deliver **uncertainty signals**, **constraint checklists**, and **evidence cards** (what was considered, what was discarded, what constraints bound the recommendation).
* **Human‑in‑the‑loop design**: interfaces that require **justification before action**, capture **counterfactuals**, and support **red‑teaming** of plans.

### Evidence and testbeds

I validate across **multiple STS domains** to demonstrate **breadth and transfer**:

* **Finance/regulation**: policy interpretation, audit‑style reasoning, quantitative‑textual synthesis.
* **Government/security**: open‑ended planning and risk assessment under rules of engagement and legal/political constraints.
* **Law/medicine**: guideline‑constrained decision‑making with traceable evidence.
  Open‑ended **language‑based wargaming** appears as **one testbed among several**, chosen for its planning and negotiation structure—not as the sole focus.
 -->

### Impact

RAPID‑AI offers **practical, auditable upgrades** to LM decision support: better **reasoning quality**, **transfer across domains**, and **transparent rationales** that help practitioners **trust but verify**. This contributes both to science (generalizable training/eval methods) and to institutions that must make decisions **safely and effectively**.
