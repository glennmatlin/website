# Task Completion Checklist

When a task is completed, follow these steps:

1. **Preview the site** - Run `quarto preview` to verify changes render correctly
2. **Check for broken links** - Ensure all internal links work
3. **Verify frontmatter** - All .qmd files must have valid YAML frontmatter
4. **Check dark mode** - If CSS changes were made, verify dark mode still works
5. **Check responsive** - If layout changes were made, check mobile view
6. **Ask user about committing** - Offer three options:
   - Commit (manual staging first)
   - Commit and push
   - Neither
7. **Never suggest `git add` commands** - Per global instructions
8. **No names in commits** - Keep git commits anonymous (no names of people or AI services)
