## Glenn Matlin {.section-title}

I'm a PhD student and ML researcher building at the intersection of cutting-edge AI research and real-world applications. My work focuses on LLM evaluation, financial machine learning, and creating tools that bridge the gap between academic research and practical deployment.

### Current Focus

- **LLM Evaluation**: Developing comprehensive frameworks for assessing large language models on domain-specific tasks
- **Financial ML**: Applying machine learning to finance—risk modeling, compliance automation, and intelligent systems
- **Research to Production**: Turning academic research into deployable, impactful tools
