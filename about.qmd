## Glenn Matlin {.section-title}

I'm a PhD CS researcher at Georgia Tech advised by **Mark Riedl** (Associate Director, ML Center) and co-advised by **Sudheer Chava** (Chair, Finance). I study how to make language-model systems **reliable for socio-technical decision-making** in high-stakes domains.

My dissertation, **RAPID-AI**, integrates **grounded evaluation**, **curation-to-SFT-to-RL training**, and **assurance/interpretability** to improve **reasoning, analysis, and planning** with humans in the loop.

My work has appeared in **ACL, COLM, and NeurIPS** and has been supported in part by **DARPA**, **Together AI**, and collaborators in open-source ecosystems.

### Research Focus: RAPID-AI

- **Measurement**: Grounded, expert-level evaluations of STS knowledge and reasoning from authoritative sources
- **Training**: SFT and RL methods to improve reasoning, analysis, and planning—not just memorization
- **Assurance**: Transparency, interpretability, and trust calibration so humans can audit and rely on model recommendations
